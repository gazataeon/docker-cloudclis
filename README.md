# docker-cloudclis

Docker Containers with Cloud Vendor CLIs ( Azure/AWS for now!)

Two simple containers for managing your cloud platforms.

Both should work fine, but the Ubuntu image is there for those of you who like big packages. ( ͡☉ ͜ʖ ͡☉)

## Run examples

```docker
docker run gazataeon/cloudclis:ubuntu-18.04
```

or

```docker
docker run gazataeon/cloudclis:alpine-3.10.2
```
